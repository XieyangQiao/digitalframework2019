## 1. Silicon Valley indiactors

Is Silicon Valley losing its luster? This is one debate that I have seen in recent years both inside and outside Silicon Valley, as people started to look for the next home of innovation beyond California given the state's high corporate tax rate and costly real estate. Presented by the Institute for Regional Studies, the dataset I found offers an extensive and fresh collection of data on Silicon Valley's economic and community health trends that fall into five categories: people, economy, soceity, place and governance. I am hoping to analyze these data and statistical indicators to take a comprehensive overview of Silicon Valley and gain a deeper understanding of issues facing this dense metropolitan region.

Critique: Most of the stories I found regarding Silicon Valley are text-based rathe than interactive. This WSJ story includes a chart showing that investments in NYC tech startups have increased in recent years in comparison to Silicon Valley. I believe the story will be more effective if it includes an additional chart that depicts the number of investments in Silicon Valley tech startups. The author can even put the annual number of venture capital deals in NYC and Silicon Valley side by side to display year-over-year investment gaps.

## 2. FCC Complaint Calls 

Due to the proliferation of illegal calls and telemarketing, the FCC adopted a policy in early June that allows phone companies to block suspected illegal and unwanted calls by default without a customerâ€™s permission. Given this story context, I chose a dataset compiled by the FCC that details complaints filed by individual informal consumers regarding unwanted telemarketing or robocalls beginning on October 31, 2014. By using this dataset as a starting point, I want to explore three questions - what is the trend in terms of the number of robocalls or telemarketing concusmers are receiving? Are they stoppable? How can consumers opt out of calls from legitimate businesses?

Critique: this BI story has a clear objective and clarity. By reading the headline, readers can immediately identify the central idea: in the U.S., the number of robocalls is currently at a record high and this problem continues to exacerbate each year. That said, I do think the format should be more interactive, given that the story itself contains a lot of data and statistics that can be mapped out to allow readers a more straightforward and visually appealing way to understand the trend.
