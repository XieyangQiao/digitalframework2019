# Silicon Valley unicorns by locations   
_By Jessica Xieyang Qiao_  

In 2013, Silicon Valley investors put half of their money into startups outside the Bay Area, according to The Economist. For startup companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, I wonder where are they based and what industries are they specifically focused on. I am interested in knowing if there is a trend for companies to move out of the Bay Area? If yes, since when, where are they located and what industries are these companies in? I also want to know the tech trends in the near future. Thus, I want to categorize these companies by industries to see if they are drawn by one particular tech/service/product over another. 

Here are my data points:

* The date when they are incorporated 

* The industry that they are in (IoT, AI, blockchain, etc.)

* They location of their headquarters/offices 

* The market capitalization based on their valuations 

* The stock price (if applicable) 

I will collect the data by checking the [list compiled](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) by CB Insights and categorize the information based on my data points. I will check the company websites for incorporation dates and headquarter locations. I will check Bloomberg or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for market capitalizations. In terms of stock price, I will use Yahoo Finance for the latest shares prices.
