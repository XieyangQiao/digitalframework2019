# Assignment 4

I read an interesting [Recode article](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511540/silicon-valley-foreign-money-china-saudi-arabia-cfius-firrma-geopolitics-venture-capital) recently about how Chinese investors bring new rules to Silicon Valley and the rise of Chinese zombie funds renders the Bay Area a geopolitical minefield. In the context of this, I want to analyze the investment pattern of Chinese companies. Chinese investors are more likely to invest in what kinds of industries (energy, transport, technology, tourism, etc)? Over the years, how have Chinese companies changed their investment strategy? How should we contextualize these trends?

To do this, I will use [the China Global Investment Tracker dataset](https://www.aei.org/china-global-investment-tracker/) compiled by the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation. 

The most visually appealing element of this data story would be trends over time. I may also use a pie chart to analyze the data by industry sector. 

This story is timely given the ongoing U.S.-China trade talk and the controversy over Huawei, the Chinese multinational technology company that is in hot water in the U.S. now. 

For sources, I plan on talking to researchers at Brookings Institutionâ€™s China Center, professors who specialize in U.S.-China relationship and possibly Chinese investors. Essentially, I want to answer the question as to how have Chinese companies changed their investment behaviors in the U.S. over the years, how does that relate to the U.S.-China bilateral relationship and what kinds of impacts - both positive and negative - will that have on U.S. startups that need funds from big investors such as China?
