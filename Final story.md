## China’s U.S. footprint shrinks amid uncertainty in bilateral relationship 
### By Jessica Xieyang Qiao
While U.S. investors are concerned that China brings new rules to Silicon Valley and the rise of Chinese zombie funds renders the Bay Area a geopolitical minefield, data shows that China continues to curb its investment in U.S., amid scrutiny from Washington D.C. and the contentious U.S.-China relationship, experts say.  

#### What the data says: Chinese investment in the U.S. has become increasingly minor in size

From 2005 to 2019, China invested $185.5 billion capital, or 9.3% of its $1985.7 billion total investment overseas, in the U.S., according to data compiled by [American Enterprise Institute](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GIrAIC9a8WM2fPIgE781imGeu_a3g9UzWj0El8sw1-8/edit#gid=1259318758). 
 
The peak of Chinese investment in the U.S. happened in 2016, which accumulated a total of 63 deals valued at $55.0 billion, according to AEI data. 
 
New York and California alone account for over half of Chinese investment in the U.S., according to AEI data. That said, the prospects for Chinese spending have turned bleak as the broader economic tension is on the rise, said Huiyao Wang, founder of the Center for China and Globalization, a Chinese think tank focuses on global trade and investment.
 
“The dramatic investment growth from 2015 to 2017 is driven by a slowing Chinese economy, fluctuations in domestic financial market, and support from the Chinese government,” Wang said. “Over three years, Chinese companies invested about $90 billion in the U.S.”

As a growing number of Chinese companies started to use state-financed debt to purchase assets overseas, the Chinese government grew increasingly restrictive. In 2017, the resulting policy tightening significantly curtailed China’s outbound investment in the U.S., while Chinese firms begin divesting their U.S. business operations to pay off debts, Wang said. 

From the U.S. policy side, Trump administration’s protectionist trade stance also puts a damper on foreign capital inflows just when the rising twin deficits - when both trade and budget deficits increase - make U.S. economy increasingly depend on external financing, said Jake McRobie, economist of Oxford Economics.

The  Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), empowered by Washington, D.C., also started to vet acquisition deals between the U.S. and China, McRobie said.

“The administration is taking a more aggressive approach to controlling inbound foreign investment, particularly from China, which risks reducing crucial capital inflows,” McRobie said.  

Last year, China made 22 deals with U.S. companies and invested a total of $9.0 billion, down 62.8% from the $24.0 billion influx of Chinese capital in 2017. As of June 1 this year, China’s direct investment in the U.S. plunged to $3.2 billion, according to AEI data. 

From 2005 to 2019, 45 deals made by Chinese investors were troubled transactions, including 11 in 2016 and 10 in 2017, according to AIE data. The Chinese entities that suffered from these failed attempts include CIC, HNA, LeEco and Huawei, an allegedly state-owned institution that ignited U.S. fears about threats from the Chinese government.

Companies such as HNA, a Chinese conglomerate that involves in numerous industries such as aviation and real estate, has led the Chinese foreign direct investment boom in the U.S since 2014, Wang said. While they continue to make new investment this year, they are also forced to divest most of their previously acquired assets, Wang said. 

#### What the data says: political and regulatory attitudes shift China's investment focus

On average, out of the $185.5 billion investment in the U.S., $30.7 billion, or 16.6%, gears toward real estate, which focuses on the residential sector but also includes commercial and office space. This highest percentage is followed by 13.0%, or $24.1 billion, in transport and 12.5%, or $23.2 billion, in finance, according to AEI data.
 
“The United States has the largest, most liquid, and stable real estate market in the world, and is therefore favored by Chinese institutional and individual investors,” said Wang Zhi, policy and government professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. “Before 2005, China’s direct investment in U.S. real estate was negligibly low, and it has experienced phenomenal growth in the past five years.”
 
That said, however, the last two years saw a clear shift in Chinese investor’s investment focus from real estate to health. This year, out of the $3.2 billion Chinese investment in U.S., 61.1%, or $1.9 billion, is in the health sector. In comparison, only 15.2% is in the real estate industry. 
 
The dramatic change is the result of Chinese government’s move to limit overseas investment in areas such as hospitality, real estate and entertainment, Zhi said. Less affected by these regulatory burdens, health became one of the top sectors for China’s foreign direct investment in the U.S. in recent years, Zhi said.  
 
#### What the data says: Chinese investors target East and West Asia 
 
From 2005 to 2019, 19.8% of Chinese investment, valued at $392.7 billion, is in Europe and 15.1% in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 9.3%  in the U.S.

In 2016, Chinese investors made 63 deals with the U.S., up 65.8% year over year. A year later, however, the number of investment plunged 50.8% to 31. 

At the same time, Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa saw a promising influx of Chinese capital. In 2016, Europe secured 81 investment deals valued at $61.7 billion with China, up 55.4% from the $39.7 billion a year ago. With the number of transactions fluctuates around 72 and 70 in 2017 and 2018, the Chinese investment momentum in Europe is stable, compared to that in the U.S.

This year, however, Chinese investors seem to bring their focus back to Asia. As of June 1, 28.8%, or $14.5 billion, of the $50.5 billion Chinese investment overseas is in Southeast Asia and $13.0 billion, or 25.6%, is in East Asia.

Thailand, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations may have replaced previous investment hotspots such as Europe and the U.S., Wang said. While President Xi's Belt and Road initiative has contributed to this trend, Southeast Asia’s steady economic growth, booming market size and cultural affinity also encourage Chinese investors to seek deeper foothold in the region, Wang said. 

#### What the experts say: U.S. and China going forward

While China and the U.S. may undergo a long-term fractious phase in the political sphere, the two countries still depend heavily on each other for economic activities, Wang said. 

There are opportunities for cooperation and common interest between China and the U.S. It is nearly impossible for the United States to completely cut off Sino-U.S. collaboration, and the same is true for China, Wang said.  

“Currently, Chinese investment supports more than 150,000 U.S. jobs,” Wang said. “As of 2017, 46 of the 50 U.S. states have received direct investment from China through new projects or acquisitions of local businesses.”
