#### 1. Link to my dataset [Manufacturing and Trade Inventories and Sales](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/) 
#### 2. Questions and answers:

* Which year does the U.S. have the highest average inventory to sales - ratio? 1.348 in 2019
#### 3. My data diary 
* import the dataset to excel, delete top rows that do not contain statistics  
* select column B and C, insert pivot table using these two columns 
* insert “column B” from the dataset in the new pivot table's column A
* in the pivot table, select “add values” for column B, summarized by SUM and show as “% of grand total”
* we conclude that in year 2018, the U.S. has the highest amount of total merchant wholesalers, which is 5,933,312
* create a new pivot table for question two, select column B and C
* add column B from the inventory dataset to the new pivot table’s column A, select order by ascending and sort by column B
* in “values,” select “total merchant merchant wholesalers,” summarized by sum and show as “% of grand total”
* we conclude that the U.S. has the highest amount of inventories in 2018, which is 7,643,356
* create a new pivot table for question three, select column B and C
* add column B from the inventories to sales ratio dataset to the new pivot table’s column A, select order by ascending and sort by column B
* in “values,” select “total merchant merchant wholesalers,” summarized by average and show as default

#### 4. Headline and nut graf
##### U.S. inventory may be getting ahead of demand
###### As the U.S. inventories to sales ratio keep rising and hover around 1.35 this year, it may be a sign that inventories are getting ahead of demand. The accelerating tariffs may be a contributing factor to the softer-than-usual demand in the U.S.
